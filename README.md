# Data Transformer #

1. set data  
   - Data should be stored in memory until finished. (could later be optimized?)
   - a random id should be returned so we can do work on the data
2. refine and transform 
  - add other data depending on what you want to do
  - do work
4. retrieve result
   - clear data and invalidate id


## refine and transform ##
add extra information about the data required for work yo can execute on it.



## data and extra settings ##
data: any data
